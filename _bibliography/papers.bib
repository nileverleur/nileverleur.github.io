  abstract={Recurrent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalization is rare and the underlying mechanism is unknown. We aimed to determine the role of CD14-mediated immunity in the pathogenesis of recurrent RSV infection. We performed genotyping and longitudinal immunophenotyping of the first patient with a genetic CD14 deficiency who developed recurrent RSV infection. We analyzed gene expression profiles and interleukin (IL)-6 production by patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to RSV pre- and post-fusion (F) protein. We generated CD14-deficient human nasal epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface (HNEC-ALI) of patient-derived cells and after CRISPR-based gene editing of control cells. We analyzed viral replication upon RSV infection. Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous single-nucleotide deletion in CD14, resulting in absence of the CD14 protein in the index patient. In vitro, viral replication was similar in wild-type and CD14 HNEC-ALI. Loss of immune cell CD14 led to impaired cytokine and chemokine responses to RSV pre- and post-F protein, characterized by absence of IL-6 production. We report an association of recurrent RSV bronchiolitis with a loss of CD14 function in immune cells. Lack of CD14 function led to defective immune responses to RSV pre- and post-F protein without a change in viral replication.},
