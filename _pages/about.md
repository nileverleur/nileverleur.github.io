Nile Verleur is a sexy badass paediatric immunologist. If u don't watch out she will infect u and then skoop ur brain out. If u do watch out she might just slap you around a lil. The best defense against her is to pretend you are a cow. She luvs cows. Unreasonably so some might say. But don't say that to her if you value your wellbeing. This website contains her plan for world domination. 

Nile Verleur is a PhD researcher affiliated with the [Oxford Vaccine Group](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk), where she specializes in the intersection of paediatric mucosal immunity and genetics. Nile is interested in advancing our understanding of mucosal immune niches and host-pathogen interactions. Her work centers on identifying pediatric immune targets and personalized interventions, a passion ignited by her clinical involvement with infants facing rare genetic disease susceptibility to common pathogens.

Nile is currently running the world's first large-scale human co-infection trial ([RESPECCT](https://trials.ovg.ox.ac.uk/trials/sites/default/files/trials_attachments/RESPECCT%20Participant%20Information%20Sheet%20V1.3%2008%20April%202024_0.pdf)) which aims to understand the human nasal immune response when exposed to multiple pathogens (a common occurrence) in order to develop future treatments or vaccines. 

Beyond the lab, Nile is interested in scientific communications, femtech and biotech. She has a history of working with education-focused non-profit organizations and collaborating extensively with colleagues, stakeholders, and participants to deliver [result result result???]. As Assistant Director of Communications for [Nucleate UK](https://nucleate.xyz/locations/united-kingdom/), Nile leads a team of graduate students and researchers, managing branding, social media, and the generation of educational content for an internationally renowned student-run organization supporting student access to the biotech ecosystem and founder education across the UK.

Nile credits everything to her darling [Chullstopher](https://chris-hull.com), the apple of her eye and the banana of her soul.

BABY <3 <3 <3. You solved the riddle!!! Here is your own personal website template. Happy 2025 :)
If you don't want it, you don't have to keep it. But I think deserve your own website and one day you will be a famous science-preneur so it could be cool to start building up your brand. Plus it's fun to have a website. 
Click around the site to get a feel for it and the different pages you can have on it. (omg look there's a convenient blog page!).

If you do want to keep it, I can show you how to run the site, change things, post things, etc. It's not terribly complicated but there are some potentially confusing bits -- luckily you have 24/7 access to an IT guy ;). Or if you don't want to learn how to admin the website but you want to keep it, I can do it for you. 
Love you <3 <3 <3
Chris
