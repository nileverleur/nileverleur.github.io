<!-- 
This page could be used for courses you've taught or TA'd. Or for courses you've made study guides/flashcards for. Especially if you still have them, could be a place to amalgamate stuff? OR maybe you can get creative and do something else. 

For now, this page is assumed to be a static description (i.e. just text on a page). But you could convert this to a collection similar to `_projects/`, so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.
