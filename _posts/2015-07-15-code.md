This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```R
code code code
```
````

````markdown
```R
# If needed, install the BiocManager package to manage Bioconductor installations
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}

# Install DESeq2 if not already installed
if (!require("DESeq2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
}

# Load the DESeq2 library
library(DESeq2)

# 1. Simulate some example count data
#    - 10 genes (rows)
#    - 4 samples (columns)
count_data <- matrix(sample(1:1000, 40), ncol = 4)
rownames(count_data) <- paste0("gene", 1:10)
colnames(count_data) <- paste0("sample", 1:4)

# 2. Create a sample metadata table
#    - Here we have two conditions: "control" and "treated"
sample_info <- data.frame(
  row.names = colnames(count_data),
  condition = c("control", "control", "treated", "treated")
)

# 3. Create a DESeqDataSet object from your count matrix and metadata
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
  countData = count_data,
  colData   = sample_info,
  design    = ~ condition
)

# 4. Run the differential expression pipeline
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# 5. Extract results (log2 fold changes, p-values, adjusted p-values, etc.)
res <- results(dds)

# 6. Look at the first few results
head(res)

# 7. Visualize the results with an MA plot
plotMA(res, main = "DESeq2 MA-Plot", ylim = c(-2, 2))

# 8. Export the results to a CSV file for further use or sharing
write.csv(as.data.frame(res), "deseq2_results.csv")
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 \* bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

````markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
````

Which displays:

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %} <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;

}

{% endhighlight %}
